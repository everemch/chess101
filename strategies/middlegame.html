                <h2>Middlegame</h2>
                <p>
                    The middlegame is the largest phase of the game. Once the opening moves have been played and
                    the Kings are moved to safety, the game can become rather complex. Players must maintain strong
                    positional awareness to avoid any blunders or mistakes. Players should continue developing their 
                    position following opening guidelines such as "Controlling the center" or "Moving the King to safety". 
                    Players can trade pieces to develop a stronger pawn structure or they can progress their flank pawns 
                    to create threats on one side of the board. Truly, there is no correct way to play the middlegame 
                    as any position might be vastly different.

                    <h3>Middlegame - Italian Opening</h3>
                    <p>
                        Here is a likely middlegame position reached after an Italian opening. Black castled queen side
                        and moved their light squared bishop to h5 pinning the knight. White cannot move the knight as 
                        they would lose the queen. However, there is opportunity to trade pieces by attacking with Kxe5 
                        and forcing a trade of queens. This would actually be a great move if the goal is to draw the 
                        game. In some tournaments, players can advance with only a draw and thus a draw can be desireable. 
                        Simplifying the board and trading pieces reduces the chance of mistakes and tends to lead to a draw.
