                <p>
                    Most commonly used openings focus on three things.
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Control the center
                            <h6>Having control of the center allows for greater development.</h6>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            Develop your pieces
                            <h6>Developing pieces allow for more control of the board.</h6>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Castle your king
                            <h6>You can't win if you get mated, protect your King by castling.</h6>
                        </li>
                        
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Ruy Lopez - Spanish Game</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Ruy Lopez — also known as the Spanish game — is named after 
                        Rodrigo (Ruy) Lopez de Segura, a Spanish bishop who analyzed this 
                        opening in 1561. The starting position of the Ruy Lopez is reached 
                        after the following moves: 1. e4, e5; 2. Nf3, Nc6; and 3. Bb5.
                    </p>
                </div>

            <div class="subheading main-img-container">

                <div>
                    <h3>Italian Game</h3>
                    <p>
                        In this opening, Bc4 eyes black's potentially weak f7 pawn, 
                        but over the years, improved defensive techniques have shown 
                        this to be less dangerous to black than Bb5. Still, the 
                        Italian game often leads to aggressive, open positions, 
                        which can be fun to play. This opening is still used at all 
                        levels and is quite popular among club players.

                    <h3>Sicilian Defense</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Sicilian defense (1. e4, c5) is 
                        black's most popular response to e4, 
                        especially at the highest levels of chess. 
                        By playing c5, black immediately fights for t
                        he center and attacks d4 but avoids the symmetry of e5. 
                        The Sicilian defense typically leads to a complex and 
                        dangerous struggle where both sides can play for a win.
