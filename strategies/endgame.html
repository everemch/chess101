                <h2>Endgames</h2>
                <p>
                    Endgames occur once most major pieces have been removed from play. Tactics are as important
                    as ever when every move risks losing the game. Typically, the big ideas in endgames are to
                    push passed pawns to achieve or threaten promotion, to activate your King as a piece,
                    and playing with an end goal in mind.
                </p>
            </div>

                    <h3>Passed Pawns</h3>
                    <p>
                        Passed Pawns are pawns with no other pawns blocking or threatening the file of that pawn. They
                        threaten to promote into stronger pieces and are realistically stronger than normal pawns as
                        they
                        threaten a piece advantage.

                    <h3>Activate Your King</h3>
                    <p>
                        A piece not utilized is a worthless piece. Even the King can be an attacking piece threatening
                        to win material. When safe to do so, push your King to fortify a forward position. The king
                        can support the Pawn Chain in holding ground and giving other pieces opportunity to win
                        material.

                    <h3>Be Mindful of Your Goal</h3>
                    <p>
                        The goal might not be to create a checkmate. The goal might be to create a Passed Pawn, or
                        exchange pieces in a way that creates a desireable pawn structure. Whatever the goal is,
                        have one in mind at all times and take the time to make moves that align with that goal.
                        I often find myself wondering if making a trade is the best choice, that is the opportunity
                        to explore your options and focus on your goal.
