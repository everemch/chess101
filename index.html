                <p>
                    Chess has been around for ages. Lots and lots of ages actually. The game has more or less stayed
                    the same. With one very simple premise. Checkmate your opponents King, or get checkmated trying.
                    The playing field is a simple 8x8 board of checkered tiles. A set of white pieces and a 
                    mirrored set of black pieces.

                    <h3>How to play</h3>
                    <p>
                        White will begin the match by playing the first move. Many argue that white has an advantage
                        playing the first move as well. Your first line of defense is composed of 8 Pawns. These Pawns
                        are the least valuable pieces on the board, however together, they become some of the most 
                        important pieces later on. Each player plays a single move each turn until either, time runs out or
                        a player has created a checkmate.
                    </p>

            <div class="subheading">
                <h3>Checkmate</h3>
                <p>
                    The idea of a 'Checkmate' is simple. A King is in 'Check' when an opposing piece is threatening
                    to take the King. If the player does not have a move to remove this 'Check' then the King is therefore
                    Checkmated and the game is over. As you can see, the game of Chess is as much about attacking as it is about
                    defending.
