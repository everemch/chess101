                <p>
                    The rules are simple. Each player takes turns making a single move. The goal is to checkmate
                    the opponents King. In most games, players will play with time limits. This forces the player
                    to find moves quickly. Players must play a move on every turn, if that move lands on an enemy
                    piece, that piece is thus captured and removed from play.

                    <h3>End Conditions</h3>
                    <p>
                        The game can end in various ways. A player may resign at any time if they feel they have lost.
                        Players may also agree to a draw. A draw can be forced if there is insufficient material or
                        if one player is forced into a stalemate, where they have no legal moves but are not in check.
                        Finally, a player can win by checkmating the opponents King.
