                <p>
                    The history of chess can be traced back nearly 1500 years to its earliest known 
                    predecessor, called chaturanga, in India; its prehistory is the subject of speculation. 
                    From India it spread to Persia. Following the Arab invasion and conquest of Persia, 
                    chess was taken up by the Muslim world and subsequently spread to Spain and the rest 
                    of Southern Europe. The game evolved roughly into its current form by about 1500 CE.

                    <h3>Modern Chess</h3>
                    <p>
                        Chess, though seemingly simple and straightforward, is constantly experiencing growth 
                        in both strategy and theory. In fact, technology has exponentially accelerated the growth
                        of Chess strategy through the use of Chess computer engines. Computing possible positions
                        and showing the best possible move in any position. Modern Grandmasters utilize engines to
                        study possible lines and strategies. Where in the past Chess players may have had large teams
                        of individuals researching positions, computers can perform the work much faster and with less
                        risk of error.

                <h3>Chess Engines</h3>
                <p>
                    Chess Engine technology is experiencing rapid growth. In fact, modern Chess Tournaments have
                    implemented anti-cheating measures to prevent players from accessing engines. Players are only able
                    to use engines to study prior to any match and also to review matches to see where they may have gone
                    wrong. For many, relying on purely theoretical computer lines is actually a detriment. One cannot possibly
                    memorize every possibility and move given by an engine. Instead, beginners should focus on learning theory
                    and themes rather than memorizing possible lines. There are billions of positions in Chess and learning 
                    themes allow players to have stronger intuition and make better 'human' moves.
